# Hg_SOM

This repository contains Octave/MATLAB scripts for training and visualizing Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) applied to Horvat et al., 2003, Kotnik et al., 2007, 2015, & unpublished data provided by L.E. Heimbürger-Boavida and D. Amoroux methylmercury (MeHg), dissoveld gaseous mercuryDGM and total mercury HgT observation dataset.  
The workflow loads, normalizes, and models environmental and biogeochemical data to explore patterns between MeHg concentration, temperature, salinity, and oxygen.

# Usage

To fit, evaluate, and project the Hg distribution models, open and run **Hg_SOM.m**.

## Software used
